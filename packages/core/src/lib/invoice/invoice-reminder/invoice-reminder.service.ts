/**
 * Emails the client of an unpaid invoice a payment reminder, when its organization turned them on
 * (`organization.invoiceRemindersEnabled`): three days before the due date, then one, seven and fourteen days after
 * it (see `invoice-reminder.rules.ts`), until the invoice is paid in full.
 *
 * - **Which invoices.** Sent and not paid in full (status SENT, VIEWED or PARTIALLY_PAID, not marked paid, something
 *   left to pay), not an estimate, not archived, of an active organization that turned the reminders on, and emailed to
 *   the client from the platform since invoices record where they went (`estimate_email.invoiceId`). An invoice sent in
 *   another way (marked sent, sent to a connected organization) has no address to remind, and gets nothing.
 * - **To whom, in what.** The address the invoice was last emailed to, in the language it was emailed in, with the
 *   invoice attached again as a PDF (sent without it when the PDF cannot be rendered), the amount left to pay, the due
 *   date as the organization writes a day, and the link to its public page when the organization generated one.
 * - **Never a burst.** Only the latest step whose moment has come is due, and only for two days: turning the reminders
 *   on, or a sweep that did not run for a while, never sends a client the reminders of the past at once. None goes
 *   within a day of the invoice's own email.
 * - **Once, whatever the processes.** The sweep inserts an `invoice_reminder` row for the invoice, the step and the due
 *   date before it sends, and the row is unique on the three: when several processes sweep at once, one insert goes
 *   through and the others send nothing. A send that fails gives the row back, so the next sweep tries again while the
 *   reminder is due. A process that stops between its claim and its send leaves the claim unsent: that reminder is lost
 *   rather than risked twice, since an email, unlike a notification, cannot be looked up once sent.
 * - **Tenant by tenant.** Every read names the invoice's tenant, and each email goes through its organization's mail
 *   settings and is filed in its email history, which is where the organization sees the reminders it sent.
 * - **Never an empty email.** The renderer answers an empty email for a template it cannot find, so while the
 *   `invoice-reminder` template is not seeded (its migration failed), the sweep sends nothing and says so.
